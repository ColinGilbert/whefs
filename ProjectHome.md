# Welcome to the whefs Project #

whefs ([WanderingHorse.net](http://wanderinghorse.net/) Embedded Filesystem) is an Open Source C library implementing an embedded/virtual filesystem. It works by creating a "filesystem" inside a so-called container file (or in memory). This API can then treat that container similarly to a filesystem. In essence this is similar to conventional archives (e.g. zip files), except that this library provides random-access read/write support to the filesystem via an API similar to the conventional fopen(), fread(), fwrite() and friends.
